How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
-analogous lines of code from both files presented one below another - easy to compare. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
-easy comback if I got stuck going in the wrong direction
-can see my develpement - motivating
-can find some useful ideas thrown away before but possibly interesting today

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
-pros:
	*gives chance to apply some logic of commiting
	*is up to the programmer's prefference
	*gets more efficient with the programmer's experience
	*encourages thinking of the code as set of logically combined parts
-cons:
	*requires constant attention (not to forget)
	*in case of power breakdown in the middle of making commitment the job done will have to be repeated

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
-it may depend on whether a control system is suited for storing/editing codes/sets of related files, or just storing unrelated files. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-git log shows ID, time and comments of all commits in the projects
-git diff lets to compare two (or more?) commits with detailed changes in each one.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
-it enables finding last working version and restoring it easily
