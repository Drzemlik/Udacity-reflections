When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-if I wanted to make my projects/changes to a project visible to others, while cooperating on projects with other people

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-forks: copy others' repository to my github account; used within remote
-clones: copies a repository's content from remote to local, or within local only; used in remote-local or local-local 
-branches: versions of a file; used to create/work with new versions of a file
