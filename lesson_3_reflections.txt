When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-if I wanted to make my projects/changes to a project visible to others, while cooperating on projects with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-to detect if any changes have been made in remote since last time I checked.
